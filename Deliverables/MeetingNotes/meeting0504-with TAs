[Agenda]

0. Get feedback from the TAs
- MENTION HEROKU SERVER CONSTRAINT

1. Walk through the current extension implementation details
	a. Internationalization
	b. Rating
	c. comment display
	d. visual improvement (CSS) - generally good

2. Extension issues:
- Lazy loading (people has more than one thousand friends
- Internationalization collapses when the facebook calls back
- anonymization 

3. Discuss more on the project extension
2nd-round brainstorming on possible extensions:

           [Eric] internationalization(semi done, puzzling about redirection)
           [Eric] more css
[Minshu] vote up/down
[Wei] lazy loading: for demo, limiting # profiles is fine;
[Wei] gender preference: not that necessary       
           [Minshu] “favorites”
           [Pasin] categorized rating of profiles. sorting / filtering/search
(rating criteria: appearances, EQ, IQ, bangability)
	
[Wei] admin? AFTER OTHER FEATURES ARE DONE
           


      b. 	Finalize Extensions Design (Push to later)
	context, OM, challenges, new features, GUI, 
      c. Discuss Challenges and Risks (Push to later)

      d. more rigorous fake account check (if a user is changing gender or having too little number of friends, the user need to contact us for verification for potential fake id)
